## ChangeLog v1.0.11-pre ()

+ Stopped vendoring wfa2lib by default - so now the Debian build command is
  `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DZIG=OFF ..`

Vcflib maintenance release

+ Fixed vcfwave bugs - thanks Andrea Guarracino!

+ Fixed tabixpp script - thanks Blaise Li!
+ Improved for vcfwave the wfa2lib build, fixed running tests with upstream build update
+ Removed deprecated binary_function
+ Removed unused files from repo
+ Updated README

## ChangeLog v1.0.9 (20230211)

Vcflib maintenance release - mostly for including in Debian

+ Another fix so downstream packages, such as freebayes, no longer need WFAlib.

## ChangeLog v1.0.8 (20230210)

Vcflib maintenance release - mostly for including in Debian

+ Another fix so downstream packages, such as freebayes, no longer need WFAlib.

## ChangeLog v1.0.7 (20230207)

Vcflib maintenance release - mostly for including in Debian

+ Fixed regression discovered by garguantua_kerr and atille of Debian (thanks!)
+ Added note on bio-vcf in vcffilter doc
+ notes on vcfcreatemulti and backtracking
+ CMake: honour include(GNUInstallDirs) paths (I forgot)

## ChangeLog v1.0.6 (20230129)

Vcflib maintenance release - mostly for including in Debian

+ Fixed zig complaining about leaking memory
+ Added CMake Debian support with -DWFA_GITMODULE=OFF
+ Introduced CMake include(GNUInstallDirs)
+ Successfully built wfa2 using embedded CMakeLists.txt
+ Cleaned up CMakeLists.txt removing comments etc.
+ Reintroduced vcfcreatemulti in legacy mode when ZIG=OFF (for Debian)

## ChangeLog v1.0.5 (20230116)

Vcflib's first *Humpty Dumpty* release: [vcfcreatemulti](./doc/vcfcreatemulti.md) is the natural companion to [vcfwave](./doc/vcfwave.md).

Often variant callers are not perfect.
**vcfwave** with its companion tool **vcfcreatemulti** can take an existing VCF file that contains multiple complex overlapping and even nested alleles and, unlike Humpty Dumpty, take them apart and put them together again.
Thereby, hopefully, creating sane VCF output that is useful for analysis and getting rid of false positives.

We created these tools by including the state-of-the-art [biWFA](https://github.com/smarco/WFA2-lib) wavefront aligner.
The tools are particularly useful for the output from structural variation callers and pangenome genotypers, such as used by the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) because of overlapping ALT segments.

Important changes:

+ vcfwave is introduced and vcfallelicprimitimes is now considered obsolete
+ INFO fields output order is now the same with every tool as on input parsing
+ vcfwave check merging of genotypes - write tests
+ vcfwave recompute AC, AFs from merged record
+ Added python bindings with pybind11
+ introduced the zig compiler with vcfcreatemulti.cpp as a first target (use cmake ZIG=OFF to disable). At this point the zig version (-n switch) gives identical results.

Introduction of O(n) wavefront algorithm WF to replace O(n^2) Smith-Waterman SW. Note that the output is different from the original SW implementation. SW is still optionally available but considered obsolete. Use the bi-directional vcfwave instead of vcfallelicprimitives.

+ Added realignment using the wavefront algorithm (now the default). See [vcfwave](./doc/vcfwave.md) (thank you Erik Garrison https://github.com/ekg and Santiago Marco-Sola  https://github.com/smarco).
+ WFA2-lib fix is merged upstream. Fixes bleeding in of macros https://github.com/vcflib/vcflib/issues/359
+ Support longer read inversions in vcfwave!
+ vcfallelicprimitives now considered legacy/obsolete
+ Fixed allowing for different field order - see https://github.com/vcflib/vcflib/issues/365
+ Improved CMake configuration
+ vcflib compiles with both gcc and clang++ and tests pass, see [guix-clang.scm](./guix-clang.scm) - mind that git submodules such as WFA2-lib still override to gcc
+ Fixed local build for tabixpp+htslib - note that htslib should be an upstream released version (currently 1.15.1). Unfortunately git submodule does not handle tags.
+ Fix for -L switch for vcfallelicprimitives
+ Added libasan and lto support
+ Removed useless googletest submodule
+ Moved git submodules into ./contrib
+ Added python testing framework
+ Added tabixpp back in as a submodule, fixes https://github.com/vcflib/vcflib/issues/305
+ Optimizations and bug fixes. (thanks @mphschmitt)
+ vcfcreatemulti merge multiple rows
+ rewrite of vcfcreatemulti using zig
+ vcfcreatemulti merge genotypes correctly, with tests
+ vcfcreatemulti adjust info and genotypes for variants that have multiple alts already (now errors)
+ vcfcreatemulti handle phase
+ vcfcreatemulti document building with zig
+ vcfcreatemulti added progress bar to vcfwave and vcfcreatemulti with update to tabixpp
+ vcfcreatemulti default vcfwave and vcfcreatemulti to nextgen mode
+ vcfcreatemulti check file is sorted for vcfcreatemulti and improve suggestions

## ChangeLog v1.0.2 (20210104)

This is a maintenance release of vcflib, mostly improving the build
system, CI and generating markdown docs as well as man pages.

+ Removed tabixpp and htslib source dependencies, i.e., we are now using
  the distro provided libraries and include files through pkg-config.
  See also the [README](README.md#build-from-source)
+ Removed the tabixpp+htslib git submodules
+ Generalise and document the cmake build system
