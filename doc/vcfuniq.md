# NAME

**vcfuniq**

# SYNOPSIS

**vcfuniq** <vcf file>

# DESCRIPTION

List unique genotypes. Similar to GNU uniq, but aimed at VCF records. **vcfuniq** removes records which have the same position, ref, and alt as the previous record on a sorted VCF file. Note that it does not adjust/combine genotypes in the output, but simply takes the first record. See also vcfcreatemulti for combining records.
